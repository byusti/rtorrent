# rust-torrent

A BitTorrent client for the console. The goals for this project were to teach myself rust in an applied setting, and to learn more about networking, specifically p2p networking.

## Usage
An installation of rust is required to compile the client.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/byusti/rust-torrent.git
cd rust-torrent
cargo run -- [Path of Torrent File] [Path of Destination]
```
